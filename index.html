      <h2>To My Sweetest, Most Gorgeous Baby 💌</h2>
      <p>
        To my sweetest, most gorgeous, lovely baby,

Happy, happy birthday!! 🎉🎂
Even though we're miles apart right now and I can't be there to celebrate this special day with you physically, please know that my heart is right there beside you, probably glued to your side forever, like a clingy glue. 😌💗

I miss you like crazy. As in, super duper miss youuu naaa huhu. And that's saying something! 😩 Every day without you feels like I'm going to die soon. Super lungkot, may slow-mo, tapos biglang flashback ng mga lambing mo. 🥹💕

But today isn't just any day, it's your day! And I hope you feel just how loved, adored, and cherished you are, not just by everyone around you, but especially by me. You're my sunshine, my peace, my favorite notification, and

honestly, the reason I smile for no reason (and look like a fool in public sometimes, salamat ha 😆).

Even though I can’t wrap you in a birthday hug right now (kung nakakapag teleport lang talaga ako byy, aaraw arawin ko talaga HAHAHAHA), I’m sending you all the warmth, lambing, and tight cuddles through this message.

Consider it a virtual yakap, plus bonus forehead kiss 😘.

You deserve all the best today and every day, byyy. So eat like a princess, wear that cute smile, and don’t forget to enjoy your day. I'm always here if you need someone oki, your'e not alone anymore. You have me ALWAYS.

Can’t wait to see you, hold you, and finally celebrate together (kahit belated, basta ikaw!).
I love you sooo much baby, always and forever. 💕🥰 <br><br>

Hulog ka ng langit,<br>
binigay ka sakin<br>
I'll cherish you forever,<br>
'till my heart stops altogether<br>

Happy Birthday, my wife.
Mwah! 😘💕
